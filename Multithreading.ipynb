    "# Multithreading in Python refers to the concurrent execution of multiple threads (smaller units of a process) within a single process. This allows a program to perform multiple tasks simultaneously, making better use of system resources and improving performance in certain situations.\n",

    "# 1) Concurrency: Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently, which is useful for tasks that can be performed independently, such as I/O operations.\n",
    "# 2) Responsiveness: In GUI applications, multithreading keeps the application responsive to user interactions while performing time-consuming tasks in the background.\n",
    "# 3) Performance: Although Pythonâ€™s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) can limit the performance benefits of multithreading in CPU-bound tasks, it can still be useful for I/O-bound tasks where threads spend much of their time waiting for external events (e.g., file I/O, network communication).\n",
